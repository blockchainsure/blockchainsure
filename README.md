# Hi, We're Blockchainsure.

At Blockchainsure, we're building insurance protocols that strategically de-risk the world's most pressing challenges.<br>

### What We Believe<br>
For the world to change, **we need innovation**. But innovation involves risk, and the cost of risk is often prohibitively high. In the same regard, we can advance innovation, perhaps exponentially, by strategically nullifying key risks.<br>
<br>
Strategic risk nullification can remove roadblocks impeding effective policy, productive experimentation, and the adoption of new technologies. Thus, we believe the thoughtful implementation of effective risk solutions can improve the lives of billions of people.<br>
<br>
At Blockchainsure, we are 100% focused on building and implementing these risk solutions.<br>

### Our Advantage<br>
Blockchainsure is a deep tech organization engaged in primary research. We leverage a unique economic paradox in public blockchains to engineer bespoke insurance contracts that do not require third-party oversight. While we do not believe we can replace existing insurance systems, our technologies remove accessibility barriers that prevent >85% of the world from using traditional insurance.<br>

### Our Experience<br>
Ever since the Ethereum whitepaper introduced the possibility of blockchain-based parametric insurance, web3 projects have attempted to use smart contracts to automate and replace traditional insurance. **This approach does not seem to work**. Specifically, these contract structures invariably introduce significant cost inefficiencies as well as new and dangerous risks; in other words, they achieve the exact opposite of their intended outcomes.<br>
<br>
We believe there is a better way. A genuinely revolutionary approach that drives down user costs, increases efficacy, and eliminates key risks. Our mission is to build a **universal de-risking engine**, empowering user communities to drive massive change in the world by helping them nullify the risks that hold them back.<br>
<br>
We hope you'll join us.
