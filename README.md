# Monetary Innovation for a Better World.
Blockchainsure's mission is to ensure next-generation monetary systems benefit all of humanity.<br>

### What We Believe
Blockchains have ushered in a new era of financial innovation, and global monetary systems are facing an inflection point.<br>
<br>
The reimagination of these financial systems can solve long-standing inequities affecting billions of people – but only if we are thoughtful and precise about technology implementation and sustainability.<br>
<br>
At Blockchainsure, we are attempting to build technologies for safer, fairer monetary systems.<br>

### Our Research
Blockchains are not simply new technology. Instead, they also involve communities of people and economic systems — often in new, unexpected ways. Because of this, blockchains excel at solving problems we couldn't easily solve before.<br>

### In Development
We are currently investigating the viability of hybrid frameworks for managing value-stable digital currencies.<br>

### On Value-Stable Currencies
While developing insurance contracts on public blockchains, we realized the underlying infrastructure of common digital assets would fail over time. For instance, if you price contracts in Bitcoin or Ether, the price volatility in any calendar year introduces too much risk. Similarly, if you price contracts in stablecoins, the stablecoin issuer can introduce catastrophic risks where there previously were none. The underlying challenge is that the world does not have a politically-neutral, value-stable, international standard of value that is safe to use in the long term. We are deeply interested in figuring out what such a theorized currency might realistically look like and how it can be managed transparently and without political interference.
