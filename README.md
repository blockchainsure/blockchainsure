## Hi, We're Blockchainsure ðŸ‘‹

At Blockchainsure, we're building insurance protocols that strategically de-risk the world's most pressing challenges.<br>

### What We Believe
For the world to change, we need innovation. But innovation involves risk, and the cost of risk is often prohibitively high. In the same regard, we can advance innovation, perhaps exponentially, by strategically nullifying key risks.<br>
Strategic risk nullification can remove roadblocks impeding effective policy, productive experimentation, and the adoption of new technologies. Thus, we believe the thoughtful implementation of effective risk solutions can improve the lives of billions of people.<br>
